# Overview
MitoSeek is an open-source software tool to reliably and easily extract mitochondrial genome information from exome sequencing data. MitoSeek evaluates **mitochondrial genome alignment quality, estimates relative mitochondrial copy numbers, and detects heteroplasmy, somatic mutation, and structural variance of the mitochondrial genome**.

<a name="usage"/>

## Usage
Example code for running MitoSeek with given toy dataset could be

```shell
perl mitoSeek.pl -i Examples/brca_tumor.bam -j Examples/brca_normal.bam -t 4 -sb 0 -hp 1 -d 5 -str 4 -sp 1 -sa 0
```

<a name="statistics"/>

## Statistical framework for heteroplasmy detection
We have implemented statistical framework in addition to the empirical filters. We added a function to perform a one-tail Fisherâ€™s exact test to determine if the rate of heteroplasmy is significantly greater than user defined cutoff (-hp). Moreover, MitoSeek also provides Phred quality scores based on the p-value.


<a name="fisher"/>
### Fisher's exact test

```
           major   minor    
observed    n11     n12 | n1p 
expected    n21     n22 | n2p   
           -----------------
            np1     np2   npp
where n11 and n12 are observed number of major and minor alleles,
n21 = (n11+n12)*(1-hp/100) in which hp is defined by -hp
n22 = (n11+n12)*hp/100  in which hp is defined by -hp
```

The phred score of heteroplasmy for Fisher's exact test calucated as

```
phred.score.fisher = - log10 * log10(fisher.pvalue)
```

<a name="bayes"/>
### Empirical Bayesian for Binomial proportion with conjugate Beta prior

```
                                      hp          
                                    _ ---         
                                   /  100         
likelihood.of.heteroplasmy =  1 -  |      f(x) dx 
                                  _/  0           


```

where

```
                        1             a  + n12 - 1         b  + n11 - 1  
f(x) =  -------------------------- * x            * (1 - x)
        beta(n12 +  a ,n11 +  b )                             
                                                                     

```

**_a_** and **_b_** are share parameters of Beta prior distribution, which are  estimated from 600 BRCA samples.


The phred score of heteroplasmy for Empirical Bayesian approach is calculated as

```
phred.score.empirical = - log10 * log10(1 - likelihood.of.heteroplasmy)


```




<a name="Prerequisites"/>

# Prerequisites

MitoSeek runs on 32-bit or 64-bit GNU/Linux and request perl packages like **GD::Graph::boxplot**, etc. Here are the steps you need to do to install packages needed for the **MitoSeek** program.


<a name="step1"/>

## Step1: Install perl packages required by [circos](http://circos.ca/)
MitoSeek utilizes [circos](http://circos.ca/) to plot heteroplasmy and somatic mutation, thus, perl packages required by [circos](http://circos.ca/) needed to been installed first.

```
#1) go to the circos package folder which is included as part of the MitoSeek 
cd Resources/circos-0.56/bin

#2) Check whether all the packages needed by circos plot are intalled on your PC,
#if this does not work, try 'chmod +x test.modules'
./test.modules
```
If all the packages are installed on your PC, it will look like this.
```
ok   Carp
ok   Config::General
ok   Cwd
ok   Data::Dumper
ok   Digest::MD5
ok   File::Basename
ok   File::Spec::Functions
ok   File::Temp
ok   FindBin
ok   GD
ok   GD::Image
ok   GD::Polyline
ok   Getopt::Long
ok   IO::File
ok   List::MoreUtils
ok   List::Util
ok   Math::Bezier
ok   Math::BigFloat
ok   Math::Round
ok   Math::VecStat
ok   Memoize
ok   Params::Validate
ok   Pod::Usage
ok   POSIX
ok   Readonly
ok   Regexp::Common
ok   Set::IntSpan
ok   Storable
ok   Sys::Hostname
ok   Text::Format
ok   Time::HiRes
```
Otherwise, it may look like this.
```
ok   Carp
fail Config::General is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
ok   Cwd
ok   Data::Dumper
ok   Digest::MD5
ok   File::Basename
ok   File::Spec::Functions
ok   File::Temp
ok   FindBin
fail GD is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail GD::Image is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail GD::Polyline is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
ok   Getopt::Long
ok   IO::File
fail List::MoreUtils is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
ok   List::Util
fail Math::Bezier is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
ok   Math::BigFloat
fail Math::Round is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail Math::VecStat is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
ok   Memoize
ok   Params::Validate
ok   Pod::Usage
ok   POSIX
fail Readonly is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail Regexp::Common is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail Set::IntSpan is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
ok   Storable
ok   Sys::Hostname
fail Text::Format is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail Time::HiRes is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
```

If this happens, try to install the missing packages by **cpan** (If you you don't have root previlege, please look at [here](#perlsetup) to set up your own perl environment).
```shell
#run in root if the packages will be installed in the system path
#like /usr/local/lib64/perl5
./test.modules |grep fail|cut -f2 -d" "|xargs -I {} cpan {}
``` 
<a name="step2"/>

## Step2: Install perl packages required by MitoSeek
In addition to the perl packages required by [circos](http://circos.ca/), there are several other packages needed to be installed on your PC.

```shell
#go the the folder where your MitoSeek is
#And test whether all the required modules have been installed.
./test.modules
```
The successful output would look like this
```shell
ok   Convert
ok   Cwd
ok   File::Basename
ok   File::Path
ok   FindBin
ok   GD
ok   GD::Graph::bars3d
ok   GD::Graph::boxplot
ok   GD::Graph::lines
ok   GD::Text::Wrap
ok   Getopt::Long
ok   List::Util
ok   Mitoanno
ok   Statistics::KernelEstimation
```
Otherwise, it may look like this
```shell
ok   Convert
ok   Cwd
ok   File::Basename
ok   File::Path
ok   FindBin
fail GD is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail GD::Graph::bars3d is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail GD::Graph::boxplot is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail GD::Graph::lines is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
fail GD::Text::Wrap is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
ok   Getopt::Long
ok   List::Util
ok   Mitoanno
fail Statistics::KernelEstimation is not usable (it or a sub-module is missing)
```
To install the missing packages is the same way as we did in [step1[)#step1) for those missing packages requried by [circos](http://circos.ca/).
```
#run in root if the packages will be installed in the system path
#like /usr/local/lib64/perl5
./test.modules |grep fail|cut -f2 -d" "|xargs -I {} cpan {}
``` 
<a name="step3"/>

## Step3: Build samtools
We include [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) as part of MitoSeek, however, you need to build it before you use MitoSeek.

```
#go the samtools folder
cd Resources/samtools
tar jxvf samtools-0.1.18.tar.bz2
cd samtools-0.1.18
#build samtools and move the samtools program into its parental folder
make
mv samtools ../
#remove the samtools source code if you like
cd ../
rm -rf samtools-0.1.18
```

Or you can change the **mitoSeek.pl** script and tell the program where is the samtools on your PC. Here is the line you need to modify.
```perl
my $samtools = "$FindBin::Bin/Resources/samtools/samtools";  #Where is the samtools file
```

Others
-----------------------------------

<a name="perlsetup"/>

## Configure your perl environment
Ususally you don't have root privilege and it will prevent you when you try to install perl packages by default. Here is a brief way to install perl packages without root previlege, details could be found at http://www.perl.com/pub/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html or  searching by google.

### Step 1, Setting your PERL5LIB environment variable
```
#If your own perl libary top folder is ~/perllib
#Then add the following lines in your ~/.bashrc
#because the subfolders could be different due to different versions of perl
#and linux, so to save time by adding subfolders in the PERL5LIB, we use 'for'
#to add all the subfolders. 
PERL5LIB=~/perllib
if [ -d ~/perllib ]; then
  for i in `find ~/perllib -type d`
    do
      PERL5LIB=$i:$PERL5LIB
    done
fi
export $PERL5LIB
```

### Step 2, Configure your cpan
```shell
#type cpan into cpan environment
cpan
```
Then
```shell
#In cpan environment
o conf makepl_arg PREFIX="~/perllib"
o conf commit

#exit the cpan environment
exit
```

## Mitochondrial genome information (hg19/rCRS)
Mitochondrial information we used in **MitoSeek** includes
* [Mitochondrial genome reference](#mitoreference)
* [Mitochondrial genome annotation](#mitoanno)
* [Known pathogenic mutations](#pathogenic)

<a name="mitoreference"/>

### Mitochondrial genome reference
**result folder:** yourmitoseek/Resources/genome

**Files:**
   + hg19.fasta
   + rCRS.fasta

**Links**

```shell
#1.1) rCRS assembly (rCRS.fasta)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/251831106

#1.2) hg19 assembly (hg19.fasta)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001807.4?report=genbank
```

<a name="mitoanno"/>
### Mitochondrial genome annotation
Annotation is in **genbank** format, the class/package **Mitoanno** (Mitoanno.pm) will take the .gb file and annotate the given position on mitochondria.
   
**result folder:** yourmitoseek/Resources/

**Files:**
   + hg19_annotation.gb
   + rCRS_annotation.gb

**File Name:** yourmitoseek/Resources/OMIMpathogenic.txt


<a name="exon"/>

## Whole genome exon coordinates
Whole genome exon coordinates are used to estimate the **relative mitochondrial copy numbers** when the input is exon/RNA-Seq sequencing. 

Here is the scripts we download and prepare the exon bed file

```shell
#Wkdir: yourmitseek/Resources/genome
#refGene annotation file (refGene.txt)
#description of refGene is here at 
#https://cgwb.nci.nih.gov/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=79902&hgta_doSchemaDb=hg18&hgta_doSchemaTable=refGene
wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/refGene.txt.gz
gunzip refGene.txt.gz
    
#get exon region on chromosome 1-22, and X,Y (with prefix chr or without)
perl -lane 'if($F[2]=~/chr\d+$|chrX|chrY/) {@start=split ",",$F[9]; @end=split ",",$F[10];  for($i=0;$i<$F[8];$i++) { print join "\t",$F[2],$start[$i],$end[$i],$F[12]."|".$F[1]}}' refGene.txt >refGeneExon_withChr.bed
